There were three categories (education, open innovation, and cybersecurity) to choose from and we chose cybersecurity becuase 
cybersecurity threats are becoming a more prevalent issue every day. 

We picked this becuase we believe the public needs to be educated about real issues like phishing, bad downloads, false URLS, etc.

This is an HTML/CSS website that is a tool to help educate the masses about cybersecurity and how to stay safe.

This website followed the guidelines and the theme of lanterns throughout the project.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, with all the information of the project.

← `index.html`: This is the main web page, where we included the formatting of the website, text, etc.

← `style.css`: The CSS file adds the styling elements(like our various fonts, background colors, etc.)

← `script.js`: We added things like the interactive lantern button using this JS file. 

Here is the video submission of the project:
